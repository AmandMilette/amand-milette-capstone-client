          <h2>Cozy Care For All Dogs & Cats</h2>
          <h3>Pet Care Experience</h3>
          <p>
            Hello, I'm Amand (they/them). I have grown up with dogs my entire
            life, and I started taking more of a direct role in taking care of
            the family dogs over the years when I was 10 years old. I have
            experience taking care of small, medium, and large-sized dogs from
            potty-trained puppies to senior cuties. I have provided dog walking,
            doggy daycare, drop-in visit, and house-sitting services for many
            family members and friends over the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also have 1 year of experience in taking care of cats. I have an
            equal love of cats and dogs in my heart to provide the best care for
            every pet. I have experience with taking care of single-cat and
            multiple-cat households. I have provided drop-in and house-sitting
            services to many of my cat-owning friends.
          </p>
          <h3>Safety, Trust & Environment</h3>
          <p>
            I live in a pet-friendly apartment building a short distance away
            from multiple parks & walking trails. There is a small grass area
            beside the main entrance of my building where I can easily take dogs
            out for potty breaks. I am part of the LGBTQ+ community and
            COVID-conscious (I mask indoors with KN95/N95, have up-to-date
            vaccines, and follow isolation protocols) so I will ensure that your
            pets are taken care of in my home and yours will be treated in the
            same way they are with you. I am comfortable with administering
            medication for pets, collecting mail, cleaning up pet-related
            messes, and minor grooming maintenance if requested as part of my
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            For dog boarding, Doggy Daycare, house-sitting and drop in services
            I am able to accept clients of multiple pet households.
          </p>
          <p>
            Please let me know if your precious pet has any special needs
            (physical, behavioral, etc.) in order for me to properly accommodate
            them and to provide the highest quality of care with my services.
          </p>

            Amand was kind enough to look after my cats, Baby and Charlie for
            three months while my husband and I were on an extended vacation. We
            were introduced to Amand through a friend, and Amand was very prompt
            with communication as we organized the housesitting and cat sitting
            details. Amand was reliable and attentive, sending regular updates.
            Our shy Charlie and Baby felt very comfortable and at home the whole
            time. We were able to enjoy our time away knowing our home and our
            beloved kitties were well-taken care of. I would absolutely
            recommend Amand to anyone looking to have a caring and dependable
            caregiver for their pets!
